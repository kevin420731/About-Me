My name is Kevin.Shen, my Duke Unique ID is 1195512, my Duke NetID is ks713.
First of all, I pledge that I completed all the works totally by myself.
For my design, here are the logics. First of all, I use ctrl_ALUopcode to subtract the six op code for add, subtract, and ,or, SLL,SRA, then, for which answer is 00000, that means, that is the operation we need. Before determine the operation, we call each module seperately, Because my logic of add and subtract has already been explained in detail in the README file of PC1, here I will only explain my logic of and ,or,SLL,SRA, for and and or, it is very easy, I just used two gate, and_gate and or_gate to calculate the result bit by bit, I calculate the result for and ,or operation with 32 steps each, and then, output the result. For SLL and SRA, I, followed the MUX implemented in the class, Because the opcode has 5 bit, for nth bit, if the bit is 0, then, the input should shift left or right power(2,n-1) steps, I use array assignment to complete this kind of shift. I look the number for Ctrl_ALUopcode from 0th to 5th bit . After determine the operation type, because we have got the result for calling each module seperately in the previous step. Then, we just need assign the data_result to the corresponding result. That is all the logic.
